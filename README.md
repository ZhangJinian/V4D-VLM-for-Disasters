# V4D-VLM-for-Disasters

In this repository, we adopt a modular design and multi-tool collaboration mechanism to build a unified multimodal interaction platform using the Gradio library. Core functional methods such as building damage detection are encapsulated as independent tool modules, which are integrated into the main server through a registration mechanism. This design enables the construction and deployment of the V4D (VLM for Disaster) â€” a multimodal disaster assessment intelligent agent.
